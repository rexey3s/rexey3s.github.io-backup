E.g, shutdown the power source of the target crash your machine crash your router use up a key machine or network resource Using up resource is the most common approach network bandwidth processing power RAM Network stack resources E.g., records of open connections ( TCP connections via SYN flood ) OS or application resources E.g., entries in a hash table Simple Denial of Service Attacks One machine tries to overload another machine E.g., send more packets than the target can handle There is a fundamental problem for attacker: Attacker’s machine must be more powerful than the target machine Otherwise, the attack machine can’t generate enought packets Sovling this problem by 2 possibilities: 1. Find a way to make the target pay more per message than the attacker Use more than one machine to attack 1.Make the target pay more Denial of Service and Asymmetry sometimes generating a request is cheaper than formulating a repsonse If so, one attack machine can generate a lot of requests and effectively multiply its power E.g., send random garbage packets to machine expectig encrypted packets (obviously it have to decrypt those packets, which is an expensive process) Not always possible to achieve this asymmetry but often can be done An example is SYN Flood TCP is connection-oriented Endpoints must keep information about current tcp conn. for detecting loss of packet and doing flow contronl and managing congestion Typically kept in a table of fixed size - so attack this table not the bandwidth The TCP open connection table Design to support many TCP connections at a time.E.g., for high volume web server One entry per conn. reuse an entry once the connection ends some legitimate conns. will be slow The basic of attack Attacker uses initial req/resp to start tcp sessions then he abandons them target keeps them open for a while Filling up the server’s open connection table and prevening new real tcp sessions How to defense Don’t let the attacker take too many open connection slots Maybe restrict to 3 or 4 slots per IP addr Doesn’t help if attacker has a lot of machines and attacker spoofs IP addr Drops unused conns. more aggressively so half-open conns, don’t waste the resource as long bad impact on legitimate clients Save most of your slots for good IP addr, but how about IP Spoofing Make attacker pay more he must pay sth for getting the open conns. table entry if the cost is high enough, he can’t afford to fill my table so, what currency can we make him pay in ? The solution is using SYN Cookies Good aspects of this approach doesn’t change tcp protocol doesn’t require clients to do anything doesn’t require server to save any information can be turned on and off easily "},{"title":"Advanced network security note - 3rd day of class","url":"/blog/2014/08/20/third-day-of-advancded-network-security-class","date":"2014-08-20 00:00:00 +0700","categories":["network securtiy"],"body":"Authentication and Authorization in Network Security Authentication is determining who someone is Authorization is determining someone is allowed to do something Authorization usually depends one authentication, which properly is not sufficient Perimeter of Defense and networks: Firewall Perimeter Defense The idea is building an impenetrable perimeter around something valueable to protect it History of perimeter defense : castle, fortress, The Great Wall of China, etc. But they were all failed because of perimeter defense’s weaknesses Weaknesses of Perimeter Defense models Breaching the perimeter compromises all security 2 major assumptions: The barrier is impenetrable (It usually isn’t) We can carefully control the entrance and exit points (we often can’t) What is Firewall ?

But until last week, I’ve just figured out Octopress - a blogging framework for hackers - which is framework that helps making your pesonal blog or site become easier. And one of the most important reason that I love them is they are all free! In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build a blog using Octopress. If you have already known about Jekyll, I suggest you should take a look on Octopress. Unless you have, you don’t need to know much about Jekyll because Octopress will handle it for you. First of all, we need to install and config a lot,but I’ll try to make it simple. Jekyll Installation To whom still don’t know, Jekyll is a static site generator which helps you generate your site’s or blog’s contents ( usually written in Markdown) into static contents (e.g., html, css and javascript). In addition, GitHub Pages have been using Jekyll as their pages generator , so everything you write in Jekyll will easily host on Github. Requirements Ruby >= 1.9 - Read this if you don’t have Ruby installed RubyGems Linux, Unix or MacOS Install via RubyGem ~/ 1 $ gem install jekyll Now you can easily start your site by ~/ 1 2 3 4 $ jekyll new my-blog $ cd my-blog my-blog $ jekyll serve # => Now browse to http://localhost:4000 By browsing above address you can see your beautifully simplified site now there. Early Deployment to Github Page Sign in into your GitHub account, create one if you don’t have Create a new repository with name like username.github.io E.g., my repo for this blog is rexey3s.github.io Now back to your console and make sure you have Git installed ~/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $sudo apt-get install git $cd my-blog my-blog $ git init my-blog $ git add . my-blog $ git commit -m 'Deloying my Jekyll Blog' my-blog $ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io my-blog $ git push origin master Go to your browser and pointing to username.github.io , as you can see your blog is now online without any 3rd party host. If you want to build your site from scratch, you can carefully read the docs and again deloy it to GitHub Page. There are many options to deploy a Jekyll site, GitHub Page is just a free and awesome one. But if you want a quick and easy customizable site then continue reading. Octopress Installation Setup Octopress ~/ 1 2 3 $ mkdir myblog $ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git myblog $ cd myblog Install dependencies ~/myblog/ 1 2 myblog $ gem install bundler myblog $ bundle install Install Octopress - Choose your themes ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 myblog $ git submodule add GIT_THEME_URL .themes/THEME_NAME myblog $ rake install [ 'THEME_NAME' ] myblog $ rake generate # => Now browse to http://localhost:4000 Octopress config _config.yml - Jekyll main config file ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 myblog $ vim _config.yml # ----------------------- # # Main Configs # # ----------------------- # url: http://<username>.github.io title: \"put your blog title here\" subtitle: A blogging framework for hackers. author: me description: date_format: # Format dates using Ruby's date strftime syntax subscribe_rss: # Url for your blog's feed, defauts to /atom.xml subscribe_email: # Url to subscribe by email (service required) Note: After changing any configs in _config.yml , you have to type rake generate again to take effect Octopress bundled with a lot 3rd Party setting setting ~/myblog/ 1 myblog $ vim _config.yml _config.yml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 # ----------------------- # # 3 rd Party Settings # # ----------------------- # # Github github_user: YOUR_GITHUB # Twitter twitter_user: YOUR_TWTTTER_NAME twitter_tweet_button: true # Disqus Comments disqus_short_name: DISQUS_NAME disqus_show_comment_count: false # Facebook Like facebook_like: false Comments powered by Disqus - signup one if you don’t have Learn more about Octopress config Customize your blog Changing default theme This blog uses Octostrap3 and Bootwatch Readable ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 ~/myblog $ git clone https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3 .themes/octostrap3 ~/myblog $ rake install [ octostrap3 ] ~/myblog $ rake generate Go to Bootwatch and choose the theme you like, then copy bootstrap.min.css ‘s content and replace your myblog/source/assets/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css by its content. Refresh your browser at localhost:4000/ and check out the new look. Create About page About page source/about/index.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 --- layout: page title: \"About\" footer: true navbar: About --- <div class= \"row\" > <div class= \"col-xs-8 col-md-3\" > <a href= \"#\" class= \"thumbnail\" > <img src= \"/images/bio-photo-alt.jpg\" title= \"Avatar\" /> </a> </div> <div class= \"col-xs-8 col-md-5\" > <p> Write something about you </p> </div> </div> Then navigate to source/_includes/custom/navigation.html add the following snippet to inside div.navbar-collapse tag ~/myblog/source/_includes/custom/navigation.html 1 2 3 <li> <a href= \"/about/\" > About </a> </li> Deploy to GitHub pages Now, you don’t need to run git anymore rake deploy will do it for you ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 myblog $ rake preview myblog $ # => take a look at your blog on http://localhost:4000 before were deploy it myblog $ rake setup_github_pages The rake task will ask you for a URL of your Github Repo which can be one of 2 following forms: git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git https://github.com/username/username.github.io Deploying ~/myblog/ 1 2 myblog $ rake generate myblog $ rake deploy # You will be prompted for Github username and password Now go to username.github.io and see your result. One more important thing is to backup your Octopress’s code to Github too. In ~/myblog/ dir, init a new git to push your source to a repo that would store your Octopress’s code. Note: You may not want to public your _config.yml file, then you can add it to .gitignore ~/myblog/ 1 2 3 4 5 myblog $ git init myblog $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/blog-src.git myblog $ git add . myblog $ git commit -m 'Backup src to ' source ' branch' myblog $ git push origin master Great, now your blog has been online, hosted by Github Page which is free of charge and also your source code has been subversioned by Github. Last but not least, I have to mention that your posts should been written in Markdown which allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on GitHub or anywhere that has a Markdown Conversion Tool. I pretty sure that you will find it easier than writting you own HTML ;). Here is an example to illustrate my words: I have a code snippet Code snippet example 1 $ jekyll serve If I wrote it in HTML, it would be like this: HTML elements of Code snippet example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 <div class= \"bogus-wrapper\" > <notextile> <figure class= \"code\" > <figcaption> <span> Code snippet example </span> </figcaption> <div class= \"highlight\" > <table> <tbody><tr> <td class= \"gutter\" > <pre class= \"line-numbers\" > <span class= \"line-number\" > 1 </span> </pre> </td> <td class= \"code\" > <pre> <code class= \"sh\" > <span class= \"line\" ><span class= \"nv\" > $ </span> jekyll serve </span> </code> </pre> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </figure> </notextile> </div> Then I wrote it in Markdown, which would be easily generated to the HTML above HTML elements of Code snippet example 1 2 3 ```sh Code snippet example $ jekyll serve ``` As you have seen, “` is a syntax for code snippet and sh is specified the language that it would syntax highlighted for - is this example, It is bash/shell . Markdown syntax is just beautiful and simplified. Create a new post ~/myblog/ 1 myblog $ rake new_post [ \"this_is_the_title\" ] Then, go to myblog/source/_posts/ to edit your new post, you can use any editor you like to write it in Markdown syntax. Note : the filename of your post would be in the following form year-month-day-title.md - you should not change its date prefix. So now you would be able to deploy your site online and create a new post. Please take a look at Markdown syntax link below, it will help you a lot when writing your post. Happy blogging! Here are some helpful links: Markdown Cheatsheet - The language syntax Octopress Docs Bootwatch - Bootstrap’s Themes There are still a lot interesting stuffs about Octopress that I would like to show you in the next part of this tutorial.

But brace yourself I forge my sword, day by day I don't ask enough questions To me, asking the right question is much more important than the quantity, but the problem is how do you know the right question if you don’t ask until you find it right ;)) I 'm probably not a person who could handle and accept the truth easily Don’t do what you love A few thoughts came out of my head after reading this controverial stuff. I now feel it need to be a balance between “Do what you love” and “Love what you do”. Love what you do so you can maintain and grow what you love. One more piece of art in this article that the quote from the author that I feel damn true “Don’t do something you hate for a living. Whatever you love should love you back. And if it’s not working out, it’s ok to find something else to love.” I have 46 Thanksgiving dinners left with family. And then, I’ll be dead. A little bit tragic when reading this, it reminds me about what Steve Job had said in his speech at Stanford “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important” Here is the app’s link which was mentioned in the article.
