<blockquote class="text-justify">
  <p>If you have heard someone said that it usually took 10,000 hours to learn a thing. Then, don’t believe it, it’s stereotype and reality prove a different outcome. The truth is 20 hours is sufficiently enough for you to learn anything and implement its knowlegde in practice. More details, how to do that please watch the video above. In fact, I myself have proven this theory by learning about building this blog in approximately 28-30 hours.</p>

<p>These days, extraordinary technologies &amp; techniques developed in Web Development help building a fast, scalable Web application with spectacular UI and user-friendly UX become an easier task than ever before. There are a lot of frameworks, which applied many famous design pattern like MVC and  written in many Programming Languages out there, could minimize or sometime automate your tasks such as building, testing and deploying. On the other hand, those things are now make us (developers) and our products (Web apps) all the same with others, because we all use the same tools, follow the same patterns which we consider that they are the best ones to replicate, none of us do want to re-invent the wheel. So obviously, our products which come from the same factories and the same techniques, will have none of its substance. How to avoid this scheme ? The answer is in the article.</p>

<h2 id="stories-on-mediumhttpsmediumcom">Stories on <a href="https://medium.com">@Medium</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is the reason why I start this God <em>damn</em> blog =)). Absolutely must-read article.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-lifehttpsmediumcomraymmars-reads7-reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-life-2a1841f1335d"><a href="https://medium.com/raymmars-reads/7-reasons-why-you-will-never-do-anything-amazing-with-your-life-2a1841f1335d">7 Reasons Why You Will Never Do Anything Amazing With Your Life</a></h3>

<!-- more -->

<p class="text-justify">Hmm, I have to admit that I myself caught up with 4 of 7 reasons on the list: </p>

<ol>
  <li><code>I havn't failed enough </code> 
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe try to become a failure in near future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I still care about others think about me</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Damn, sometime I just want to f**k all the thing up but I don’t have enough courage. But brace yourself I forge my sword, day by day <br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I don't ask enough questions</code>
    <ul>
      <li>To me, asking the right question is much more important than the quantity, but the problem is how do you know the right question if you don’t ask until you find it right ;))</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>I 'm probably not a person who could handle and accept the truth easily</code></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dont-do-what-you-lovehttpsmediumcomrachelnaborsdont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2"><a href="https://medium.com/@rachelnabors/dont-do-what-you-love-41312c943e2">Don’t do what you love</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">A few thoughts came out of my head after reading this controverial stuff. I now feel it need to be a balance between “Do what you love” and “Love what you do”. Love what you do so you can maintain and grow what you love. One more piece of art in this article that the quote from the author that I feel damn true</p>

<blockquote class="text-justify">
  <p>“Don’t do something you hate for a living. Whatever you love should love you back. And if it’s not working out, it’s ok to find something else to love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="i-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-family-and-then-ill-be-deadhttpsmediumcombenhuhi-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-my-family-after-that-ill-be-dead-ab4cb249eadf"><a href="https://medium.com/@benhuh/i-have-46-thanksgiving-dinners-left-with-my-family-after-that-ill-be-dead-ab4cb249eadf">I have 46 Thanksgiving dinners left with family. And then, I’ll be dead.</a></h3>

<p class="text-justify">A little bit tragic when reading this, it reminds me about what Steve Job had said in his speech at Stanford</p>

<blockquote class="text-justify">
  <p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://seeyourfolks.com/">app’s link</a> which was mentioned in the article.</p>
